My C++ sockets library for use in other applications.

The main source code is located within the "src/" folder with the following class inheritance diagram:

Socket (includes SocketException and LogFile)
|->ServerSocket
|->OperableSocket->ClientSocket

An example command to compile the source is included within the "compile.sh" script.

Basic example application source code for server and client applications are located within the "testapps/" folder.
These can be compiled by running the "servercompile.sh" and "clientcompile.sh" scripts within the root directory - the output files from these scripts will be located within the "bin/" folder.
